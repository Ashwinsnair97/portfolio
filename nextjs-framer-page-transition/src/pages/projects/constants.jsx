            <p>The Contract Commitments Dashboard is an advanced analytical tool designed to identify and outline significant risks related to materials, their suppliers, purchase groups, and sites. It features comprehensive views that highlight material demand over specific periods, associated contracts, and risk identification. The tool facilitates proactive risk mitigation strategies, ensuring informed decision-making and enhanced supply chain management</p></>),

                    Being part of this innovative project has been invaluable for my growth as a professional.

                <p>
                    The dashboard has approximately 50 unique users with around 15 active daily users. Commercial team makes supplier retention decisions and contract renewals based on supplier performance insights. This growth necessitated significant improvements in the dashboard's usability, signaling the end of the MVP phase.

                    We had to ensure consistency, scalability, and sustainability across various elements, such as modals, buttons, and different page approaches. We embarked on developing a robust design system, collaborating closely to create fully auto-layout components. Occasionally, we had to "detach" components, even though we preferred not to.

                    When discussing design systems, inspirations like Polaris, Carbon, or Atlassian often come to mind. We drew inspiration from these systems, adapting elements such as naming conventions, structure, and color systems to suit our needs. Our goal was to use the design system to enhance efficiency and tailor it to our unique requirements.
